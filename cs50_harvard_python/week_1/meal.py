# When you run a file directly (python myfile.py), Python sets the special variable __name__ = "__main__".
# When you import that same file from another module, __name__ becomes the moduleâ€™s filename (e.g., "myfile"), not "__main__".
# So it ensures that the main() function runs only if the file is executed directly.
# If the file is imported, it wonâ€™t auto-run
